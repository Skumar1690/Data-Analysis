# Crop Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the most suitable crop to grow in a particular region based on the soil and environmental conditions. By analyzing the nutrients present in the soil, such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium, as well as the pH value, average rainfall, and humidity, the model can help farmers optimize their crop yield.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/theeyeschico/crop-analysis-and-prediction/data?select=Crop_recommendation.csv).

## Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms are employed in this project:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree

## Project Overview
1. **Data Collection**: Gather soil samples and measure the amounts of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), pH value, average rainfall, and humidity.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform feature scaling.
3. **Model Training**: Train the models using the processed data.
4. **Prediction**: Use the trained models to predict the best crop to grow based on the given soil and environmental conditions.

## Importance
Agriculture is a critical sector, and many farmers face losses due to inadequate knowledge and unfavorable conditions. This model aims to address these challenges by providing data-driven recommendations to enhance crop yield.

## Getting Started
